# MiniMonoMyth
By David Bausola


MMM is a storytelling application for Weavrs.com

The narrative structure is based upon Joseph Campbell's "The Hero with a Thousand Faces" AKA The Monomyth.

You can read about the concept of the [MonoMyth on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth/)

MMM will use Weavr's memories via the Weavrs API and any other 3rd party web service with an API.

There is a [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/mmm_git/) to follow commits.


## The App

A Uzr (Weavr) will produce one blog post daily using the 17 stages of the monomyth sequencially
The HTML templates found in act 1, act 2 and act 3 are used to frame variables from generators (gennys) and stage variables scripts.
